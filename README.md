## Hi, I'm Sumit!

I build Java full stack (React / Spring boot) Web Apps which are scalable and are very efficient.
Making alternative designs for already existing sites is my way to learn more and more. 
I believe that everything has a solution, and we just have to solve it anyhow as a developer.
There is no limit to what a developer can imagine and create.
Studied Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Engineering from Sinhgad College of Engineering, Pune (2020-2024).
